# StrideFly-V1
StrideFly Live Tracking System - First Prototype implements a web-based system with off-the-shelf GPS trackers

This is the entire code for the first prototype of the StrideFly live tracking system.

The tracking server receives GPS coordinates transmitted by the trackers, processes them and stores them in the database.

The web client is both the admin platform for creating/configuring races as well as the client interface that displays the map and corresponding statistics for a live race in progress.
